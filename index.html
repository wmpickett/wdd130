            <p>My name is Wyatt Pickett, I was born in Orem but I no longer live there, in my early childhood we moved almost five times in two years! I love reading, One of my favorites is the Inheritence Cycle but, Vinland Saga is a close second. Some of my favorite movies are the Lord of The Rings trilogy and whatever I am currently in the mood for. Over the past year or so I have started to collect vinyls which is not always the cheapest hobby but I find it super rewarding. I also love being in the forest, something about natures beauty has a soft spot in my heart. I have played a lot of different sports in my childhood but my favorites are definitely football and rugby! Though basketball is definitely one of the best to watch. I am heading out in early November to serve in the Oakland/San Francisco mission, I am so excited and blessed to be able to serve. Hopefully I will grow as much as I need to so that I can be the best version of myself out there. But for now I am trying to survive college, some of my classes are a challenge but it is awesome I love the difficulty.</p>

            <p>Arizona is a great state, though the summers are extreme, winter is quite enjoyable. Arizona has amazing sunsets, and all the recreation you want within two hours driving. Arizona is also one of the newer states, it has only been a state for a little over 110 years!</p>
